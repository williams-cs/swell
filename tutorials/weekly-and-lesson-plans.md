# Weekly Plan

## Week 1: September 10
1. ~~Document how to use SWELL.~~
2. ~~Sketch road map for learning modules.~~

## Week 2: September 17
1. ~~Understand how swell, swell-ui and swell-parser fit.~~
2. ~~Find papers on (i) good intro programming syllabus, (ii) learning analytics. (Tip: Use `Google Scholar: source:` to locate papers from same conference).~~

## Week 3: September 24
1. ~~Fix at least 1 bug.~~
3. ~~Continue literature review.~~

## Week 4: October 1
1. Lay out lesson plan.
- Should we wireframe the interface first?
- How long will the session be?
2. Make interface + UI frame for a module.
4. Continue compiling literature review regarding DPM in learning.
- Sources: Chugh's paper, CHI, UIST, PLDI.
- Also look for papers that outline skill map.
5. Implement NumberEffect.
- Document steps on how to make

To read this week:
- Hutton and Meijer.

## Week 5: October 8
Reading period, so perhaps meet on a different day?
1. Create module 1.
2. Clean up `swell-ui` and document it.
- Refactor `drawGuides()`.

## Week 6: October 15
1. Create module 2.

## Week 7: October 22
1. Create module 3.

## Week 8: October 29
1. Create module 4.

## Week 9: Nov 5
1. Create module 5.

## Week 10: Nov 12
1. Create module 6.

## Week 11: Nov 19
Thanksgiving week.
1. Work on interface. Create instructional materials.
- Sidebar indicating how to use library (`print(), rect(), etc`).
2. Find ways to implement analytics.

## Week 12: Nov 26
1. Work on interface. Create instructional materials.
2. Find ways to implement analytics.

## End of Semester
1. Implement modules to teach programming through SWELL = interface + predicate checker + progress record + analytics.
2. Implement error messages that specify which parts of the environment causes the problem.

## Auxiliary Ideas
1. ~~Are `shapes` full-on classes?~~ `shapes` are functions.
14. Add rotation function.
16. Named arguments!
17. Khan Academy's 'talk-through' is cool - video on top of interactive coding env.
18. Colors?

# Lesson Plan
**NOTE:** Still unsure what the mode of instruction should be. Textual for now, but maybe should consider videos.

## Module 1

**Goal:** Learn about `print()` method, and primitive types - String and number (int?).

**Checkpoints:**
1. How to use `print()` statement and pass a number as an argument.
2. PDM.
3. How to use String value.
4. String values can also be manipulated directly.
5. Maybe a final game-like challenge for each module?

## Module 2

**Goal:** Learn about variables and binary operations.

**Checkpoints:**
1. Declare number and string variables, and print them.
2. PDM effect on declaration.
3. Binary operations. String concatenation. string + num.
4. Re-assignment, and some interesting syntax (eg. `a = a + 1`).
4. PDM effect on binary operation with variables.

## Module 3

**Goal:** Learn about shapes and sequence.

## Module 4

**Goal:** Learn about function. Maybe list also.

## Module 5

**Goal:** Learn about boolean, conditional, loop.

## Module 6

**Goal:** Final project.
