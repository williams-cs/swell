**Week 1: September 10**
1. Document SWELL.
2. Sketch road map for learning modules.

**Week 2: September 17**
1. Fix at least 1 bug.
2. Write 1 module template.
3. Understand how swell, swell-ui and swell-parser fit.
4. Find papers on (i) good intro programming syllabus, (ii) learning analytics.

**Auxiliary Tasks**
1. List doesn't seem to work?
2. `lib/logic/` seems like a bunch of binary and unary operations.
3. `lib/modules`???
4. ~~Are `shapes` full-on classes?~~ `shapes` are functions.
5. Actually, do we have a way to define class?
6. Need to understand how functions are parsed/evaluated. What is `Return.ts` for??
7. `Expression.equalsVal(right)`: returns true if the Expression equals the arg Expression (this seems like it could be handled by an 'equal' node?)
8. What is `retValID` in `Scope.ts`?
9. How to format links like in F# Cheatsheet?
10. How to draw a number? (`s = "9"; print(s)`)
11. What's going on with the different `ExpressionParser`s in `swell-parser`?
12. PDM doesn't modify actual arguments of a function call.
13. Seems like we don't need the `var` keyword to declare variables, i.e. `x = 9` is still a valid declaration.
14. Add in rotation function.
15. Add in depth parameter.
