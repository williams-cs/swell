**Week 1: September 10**
1. Document SWELL.
2. Sketch road map for learning modules.

**Week 2: September 17**
1. ~~Understand how swell, swell-ui and swell-parser fit.~~
2. Find papers on (i) good intro programming syllabus, (ii) learning analytics. (Tip: Use `Google Scholar: source:` to locate papers from same conference).

**Week 3: September 24**
1. Fix at least 1 bug.
2. Write 1 module template.
3. Continue literature review.
4. Read up for skill map too.

**End of Semester**
1. Done with all softwares.
2. Figure out how to inspect ast tree and debug specific line of SWELL code.  (Use the printing of number as an example.)

**Auxiliary Tasks**
2. `lib/logic/` seems like a bunch of binary and unary operations.
3. `lib/modules`???
4. ~~Are `shapes` full-on classes?~~ `shapes` are functions.
5. Actually, do we have a way to define class?
7. `Expression.equalsVal(right)`: returns true if the Expression equals the arg Expression (this seems like it could be handled by an 'equal' node?)
8. What is `retValID` in `Scope.ts`?
9. How to format links like in F# Cheatsheet?
11. What's going on with the different `ExpressionParser`s in `swell-parser`?
14. Add rotation function.
15. Does loop work?
16. Named arguments!
17. Standardized parameters for library functions (good  coding practice).
18. Search for papers on UIST and PLDI.
19. Look for papers in learning analytics.
20. oopsla.
