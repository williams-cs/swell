SWELL is an educational learning platform aimed at elementary aged students to help them learn the basics of code, and we are currently working on a system to provide intelligent error messages and hints to guide students through lessons without the help of a teacher. Currently, we are working on the parser library used by SWELL to implement built in error traces within parsers themselves as well as edit suggestions to optimally fix parsing and syntactic errors. These errors will be translated into readable messages, hopefully achieving the accuracy and effectiveness of a live tutor. In the future, we hope to implement tree-edit algorithms on the AST's to determine higher level logic errors within code.
